                        <p>The web has been the driving force of my root passion: learning.</p>
                        <p>I want in on that, and some 10 years ago I programmed my first site using ASP.NET.</p>
                        <p>Now, my favorite tool is React, and I maintain several sites using Gatsby as a React framework.</p>
                        <p>I also have some experience with CMS's such as Wordpress and Joomla.</p>

                        <p>Most of all I like building big architectures.</p>
                        <p>Unity has proven to be a great engine for me to power my projects, games or business.</p>
                        <p>I use C#, and this is my all-time preferred language, I feel really at home in it.</p>
                        <p>These skills translate well to eg. building business apps with Java and more complex web apps, I find.</p>

                        <h1>Media Design</h1>
                        <p>When I started my coding adventure about 10 years ago, it was writing Max MSP patches.</p>
                        <p>Being able to write code and then hear a resulting sound is magical.</p>
                        <p>And when Max MSP integrated with Ableton I knew this was going to remain my main sound design tool. Though I'm not as versed in it, I've also created some Jitter video projects in Max.</p>
                        <p>Besides this I dabbled with Supercollider, which I like a lot but never really did a bigger project with.</p>

                        <p>The guitar has been my musical limb since I was a kid. My musical language is very much shaped by it's patterns.</p>
                        <p>My main degree is that of master in the classical guitar, and I've come to feel equally at home on the electric and bass guitar.</p>

                        <p>Composing keeps holding endless wonder for me.</p>
                        <p>I studied it during and after my guitar studies, and I'll always hold it dear as my most personal medium of expression.</p>
                        <p>Exploring new ideas is a big part of the fun for me in my compositions, so I hope you find some of those in there.</p>
                        <p>You'll find me writing contemporary and more traditional classical music, as well as rock, pop and jazz inspired tunes.</p>

                        <p>Producing music started for me with my first bands.</p>
                        <p>I've worked with the majority of the most famous DAW's, but I've fallen in love with the versatilty of Ableton Live.</p>
                        <p>The synergy with Max for Live is definately a big attraction in this lovestory.</p>
                        <p>I use this software for electronic sound design, and to record and edit my music.</p>
